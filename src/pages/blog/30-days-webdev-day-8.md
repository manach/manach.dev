Today I got some work on the landing page in right after I woke up, which was good because I've had urgent things come up the rest of the day. I may be able to do a little work in the evening, but for now I want to remember the idea of doing deliberate frontend practice by building up an Astro component library. That seems like the best way to do it the way I want: by doing, say, 5 heros, and 10 buttons, and 5 cards, and styling up 5 landing pages, etc.
