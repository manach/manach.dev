Today was just some mucking around with Flexbox to get my home page looking like not-quite-a-travesty, and a little touch-up on the blog posts page. It took me a shamefully long time to get everything worked out.

Clearly some reps with Flexbox and CSS Grid are going to need to be part of this project. I remember Flexbox Zombies being good, I'll go check them out. Right now I'm going to the grocery store. Glad to have gotten today done and kept the streak alive.
