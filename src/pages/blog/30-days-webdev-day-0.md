Basic web development, the ability to build static websites quickly and well, is such a *useful* skill. Although I tend to far prefer ops and backend, I'd like to get to where I can do some basic webdev well enough to build good websites for myself, friends, and little nonprofits I want to support.

To that end, I'll be doing 30 Days of Web Dev. I'll be using Astro, Tailwind, and Netlify. I'll start by getting familiar enough with these tools to build fully static sites--ones that build to HTML/CSS only. I'd like to put together a workflow and component library where I could put together a simple website in a short time.

Next is probably Figma for wireframing.

After that is adding interactivity using Svelte, then fully-interactive apps with React.

If I spend all 30 days on the Astro/Tailwind part and don't even get to Figma, that's fine. And this roadmap can change along the way.

## Why These Tools?

#### Astro

I want to be able to build static websites using HTML and CSS only, and I want the organization and efficiency that SSGs offer. That makes Astro the clear choice--to my knowledge, it's the only SSG right now that outputs plain HTML and CSS (no JS) by default.

#### Tailwind

I love inline styling, and I love the idea of building skill with a tool that could let me be productive in a job immediately. [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) wrote an [excellent piece](https://www.swyx.io/why-tailwind) about why he prefers Tailwind.

#### Netlify

Netlify is incredibly easy to use, has amazing docs, and allows commercial sites to use their free tier. Down the road I have vague ideas of freelancing as a side gig if I enjoy this and/or get good at it, and to me Netlify is the clear choice for small business sites.

## Why Not Other Tools?

I have come to respect the role my intuition plays in learning and skill building--if the little voice inside me says "Hey, that's neat!" I'll have far more energy and enthusiasm for the project than otherwise. Plus if I'm going to be using these tools regularly, I owe it to myself to pick ones I enjoy. So "because I don't like the other tools as much" is sufficient reason in my mind. I thought about adding more detailed reasons, but honestly, I'd rather debate the sufficiency of "I don't like the other tools" than the specific merits of those other tools.

## What's Next?

I'm going to be building out a personal website using Astro and Tailwind, deployed to Netlify. Let's see how it goes!
