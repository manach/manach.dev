Day 2 was all about getting a functioning blog: working out details about the structure of my site, learning how to use components, and building dynamic routes. I got a working blog going with a test post and then called it a day.

#### Takeaways

* I paced myself well today. Definitely could have done another session at the end of this one.
* The newness of Astro means there are few blog posts and tutorials out there, and many of the materials that are around are videos, which I just don't have patience for when I'm working on a project. This is forcing me to stick to the docs, an unexpected benefit. Thankfully, the docs are excellent.
