Today I spent an unknown but embarrassingly long time trying to figure out why Astro's image optimization component wasn't working. It turns out that I was typing < Image ... /> instead of \<Image ... /\>.

This triggered a round of imposter syndrome within my head:

* "How *the fuck* do you think you'll ever be able to do this professionally in any capacity?"
* "This isn't just an intellectual failing--it's a moral failing. You make these mistakes because you're lazy and you lack discipline. You're lazy and you lack discipline because you don't give a fuck, about anything."
* "You compounded the problem by posting to a forum, where actual professional developers go to get actual work done, and by doing so you jammed up the feed with your ridiculous problem and made it harder for them to do their jobs."

Believe it or not, this internal dialogue represents very real progress for me, in that it was pretty much confined to those three comments, I was able to dismiss them almost immediately, and no more came after that. The whole dark episode took less than two minutes. And the people in the forum were kind, sympathetic, and told me about how often they'd made these kinds of mistakes.

I don't have time to tell all the stories, but my imposter syndrome used to be far worse. It's been something that has healed along with the rest of me as I've done "the work"--recovery, therapy, meditation, self-discovery, etc. So mostly I don't have any quick fixes, except for one thing in particular.

I collect tweets by experienced programmers about their failures. It has worked incredibly well. It's all I use my twitter bookmarks for, so I can do it easily as I'm scrolling through, and every few months I collect them and do a thread. [Here is the latest one.](https://twitter.com/ccsdevio/status/1494502145487347713)

If you find yourself stuck in a bout of programming-related imposter syndrome, I *highly, highly recommend* reading these or other stories of experienced devs' mistakes. It's helped me so much.

I'm headed off to visit my niece for her birthday this weekend, so it will likely be Tuesday before I pick this up again. I've been pleased with my progress so far. When I return, I'd like to give a little thought to how I'm doing this. I have a whole theory of how to learn programming more effectively, and I'd like to make sure I'm following it.
