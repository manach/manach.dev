Astro is an *awesome* tool. Its docs are excellent, and in many ways it Just Works right out of the box. 

Day 1 was spent working with Astro and getting familiar with it. I had an idea originally to start by using it to recreate template sites, but then realized that what I needed first was a working personal website with a blog, so that I could write up my progress on this project. So I spent a couple hours finding a basic template that I liked and then getting some bare bones structure: a layout, navbar, and footer. Tomorrow I'll work on getting the blog framework up.

#### Takeaways

* There will be some fighting with simple stuff in the beginning, and that's ok.
* I'm likely to run into a lot of learning-two-things-at-once issues, especially around Tailwind and CSS. That's ok too.
* I've got the idea to do this like the Maffetone Method, a workout protocol that among other things requires you to keep workouts short enough to where you could comfortably finish another immediately at the end of the first. This will be hard to stick to: I lovvvvvve hyperfocus.
* This has been fun so far! Using a tool I think is really neat makes a big difference.
