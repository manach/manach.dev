I have ADHD (and autism, but that's another post). It's wreaked a ton of havoc in my life, in large part because I didn't even know I had it until pretty recently. Among many other things, ADHD makes task inertia very difficult to deal with. This means that it's hard for me to get started on tasks, and it also means that once I get started and slip into hyperfocus it's difficult to stop.

So I'm pretty proud of myself for picking this back up again. I've added og meta fields to each blog post page as a concrete webdev win for today, and now I'm going to think about how I'm going about all this.

I believe that we don't do a good job teaching people programming. Right now the vast majority of learning materials are 95% theory/reading/watching-videos, and 5% practice. This should be flipped.

I know that I'm capable of learning how to write code well because I can write well in English. This specifically means that I can write pages and pages of prose in English that are free of spelling or grammatical errors, and that pull from disparate premises to build towards a central conclusion. My writing follows accepted best practices regarding style and tone, and I can write in a manner that will appeal (more or less) to my likely audience.

English is *far* more complex than any programming language will ever be. I learned to write in English by reading a ton of English, and by writing a good deal of English.

Along the way, I picked up the rules for correct grammar and style largely through osmosis. I've had some good and some great teachers, but by far the biggest source of my fluency in written English is that I've always been a voracious reader. It's mainly just been about repetition.

As a result, I have well-founded confidence in my ability to write English. Given the books I've read about writing, I believe the vast majority of writers learned in a similar manner.

But we don't teach people programming this way. I'm not advocating that we suddenly teach beginners by giving them codebases to read (though that's an interesting idea, and one of the things I like about Go is how accessible its source code is), but rather that we invert the current curriculum: 95% practice, 5% theory.

There is already a group of programmers who advocate learning this way, and they seem to write code with a great deal of fluency: competitive programmers.

I can remember listening to a podcast a long time ago where the guest was a former competitive programmer who had won a major international competition. He said that at that level, the competition is so intense that your code must compile without errors and run on the first try, because even simple debugging costs too much time.

So clearly it's possible to write code the same way I write English: pages of error-free lines, which all pull together to support a single focus. But if I'd like to do that, I'll need to learn the way the competitive coders learn. Turns out at least one well-known YouTube video about competitive coding suggests that people should split their time into 95% practice and 5% theory when starting out, and *decrease* the amount of time they spend on theory as they become more skilled.

This fits with the research on skill acquisition. According to psychologists, the best way to acquire a new skill is to use what's called "deliberate practice." Deliberate practice has three key elements:

1. It's difficult but not overwhelming.
2. It involves short repetitions, focused on specific aspects of performance.
3. There is immediate feedback, ideally after each repetition.

Once practice systems are being set up this way, the main thing is just to get in reps. Lots and lots of reps.

We don't teach programming this way. The standard advice is to learn the syntax as fast as possible, and then build, build, build. The problem, at least for me, with this advice is that when I try to follow it I spend the vast majority of my time digging through docs and googling errors instead of writing code. It ends up missing the first two elements of deliberate practice: it's often overwhelming and there are no short repetitions focused on specific elements. Since there are no short reps, there's also no efficient way to get in lots of reps.

So as I'm teaching myself web dev, I'd like to focus on deliberate repetition. Starting with static websites, I'd like to break down the process of building a website into component parts and then start banging out reps.

I'm interested to see how this works with my ADHD. One the one hand, I do well with routines. On the other hand, my brain has a tendency to file something as "finished" once I make a plan that I'm confident will work, and when this happens, my motivation drops through the floor. We'll see how this one goes.

While I'm here, I'll go ahead and break down the task of building a static website:

* Design--I'm leaving web design alone; I'll mainly be copying existing websites' design or somehow de-emphasizing it in other ways.
* "Dancing skeleton"--getting the bare bones of the site up and working, both in local dev environment and on Netlify.
* Getting site layout pages styled and working.
* Getting functionality like dynamically-generated pages working.
* Styling individual pages.

That's pretty much it, I believe. I've got some styling left to do on this site but it looks like the lion's share of work may already be done, which surprises me. After this I'll take a look at frontendmentor or a similar site, or just work on building out existing sites using my preferred tools. 

I don't have a concrete stopping point. I think that I'll stop when I feel like I've gotten fast enough, and I'm confident that I'll know when that is.

There may also be detours. I've written a set of prompts/questions to go along with Learn Go By Example that are intended to support a deliberate-practice approach to learning Go. They still need some work, and I'd like to both work through them and flesh them out a bit. I need a couple more projects to list on this site, and I'd like to get that one polished a bit. Plus I feel like it's an especially good application of this idea.

Anyway. I'd also like to make sure that I finish this site. So I think now I'll go ahead and link to projects on my home page, in the hopes that the embarrassment of having them out in public will get me to work on them, on this, and on \**gestures*\* everything else.
